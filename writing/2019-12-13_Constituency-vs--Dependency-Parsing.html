          <p name="30b4" id="30b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sentence parsing can be helpful in
            understanding the meaning, structure, and syntactical relationships in sentences. Two common types are
            dependency and constituency parsing which is also known as syntactical parsing. Dependency parsing is the
            process of defining the grammatical structure of a sentence by listing each word as a node and displaying
            links to its dependents. A constituency parsed tree displays the syntactic structure of a sentence using
            context-free grammar. Unlike dependency parsing which relies on dependency grammar. Both types of parsing
            are important in computational linguistics but there is much debate over which is better. Critics of
            constituency parsing say that it displays extraneous information while supporters like to visualize the
            entire sentence structure rather than just the grammatical dependencies.</p>
          <p name="28ab" id="28ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I created a dependency and constituency sentence
            tree visualizer in order to analyze the two parsing systems published as an NPM package, <a
              href="https://npmjs.com/react-sentence-tree" data-href="https://npmjs.com/react-sentence-tree"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">react-sentence-tree</a>. This
            project relied on using React as the web framework, Stanford CoreNLP as the parsing server, and
            react-d3-tree to visualize the parsed sentences. Using these technologies, I created an open-source Node.js
            package for other developers to use and expand upon along with a demo web app. With this package, I tested
            various sentences, such as sentence fragments, non-projective and ambiguous sentences to compare and
            contrast constituency and dependency parsing.</p>
          <p name="af93" id="af93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Constituency parsing is very helpful in
            visualizing the entire syntactical structure of a sentence. These parse trees can be useful in word
            processing systems for grammar checking. For example, it is very hard to parse a grammatically incorrect
            sentence. This is because if a sentence cannot be parsed then the program can make a reasonable assumption
            that the sentence contains some grammatical errors. However more often than not constituency parses are used
            as representations of the sentence and play a role in information extraction. Such as, determining the
            subject of a sentence.</p>
          <p name="e1de" id="e1de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest problem that arises with constituency
            parsing is structural ambiguity. This occurs when there are multiple grammatical interpretations of a
            sentence. The sentence “I shot an elephant in my pajamas” is a common sentence linguist use to demonstrate
            ambiguity. There are multiple ways the sentence can be understood (albeit one clearly ridiculous). Either
            the elephant was shot while the person was standing in his pajamas, the obviously correct interpretation. Or
            the elephant was shot inside of the person’s pajamas. In this example there is a structural ambiguity around
            the word “shot”, if “shot” is parsed as a verb by itself the sentence will convey the humorous meaning. When
            parsed correctly the word “shot” should be a parsed as a verb nested in a verb phrase with the corresponding
            noun phrase being “an elephant”.</p>
          <p name="5d0d" id="5d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is an example of structural ambiguity since
            “shot” can be attached to the sentence as a verb or contained as a verb within a verb phrase. The other
            common type of ambiguity deals with coordination. When phrases contain conjunction such as “and” or, “but”
            they can be subject to coordination ambiguity. For example, the sentence “Everyone here are old men and
            women”. This sentence can be understood as everyone here is an old man or an old woman, but it can also be
            parsed as everyone here is an old man or a woman.</p>
          <p name="8b7c" id="8b7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Constituency parsing can be achieved with multiple
            algorithms the <a href="http://CYK%20algorithm%20-%20Wikipedia" data-href="http://CYK algorithm - Wikipedia"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY)
              algorithm</a>, a probabilistic bottom-up approach is a popular approach along with the probabilistic
            context-free grammars (<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/pcfgs.pdf"
              data-href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/pcfgs.pdf"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PCFGs</a>) algorithm.</p>
          <p name="18c7" id="18c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My project relied on <a
              href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/" data-href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stanford’s CoreNLP</a> which uses a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-reduce_parsing"
              data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-reduce_parsing" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
              rel="noopener" target="_blank">shift-reducer algorithm</a> for syntactical parsing, primarily because it
            is more efficient than PCFG or CKY. Shift-reducing is a stack-based approach to parsing using context-free
            grammar. All tokens in the sentence are pushed onto the stack, then the top two tokens are popped off and
            matched to grammar rules and placed back onto the stack in their reduced form.</p>
          <p name="66e9" id="66e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Constituency parsers have trouble with ambiguous
            sentences, so I decided to test sentences such as “I shot the elephant in my pajamas” and “I shot the
            elephant in pajamas”. There are two interpretations of these sentences as described above. The constituency
            parser correctly parsed both sentences as the non-humorous way. Other ambiguous sentences such as “I saw a
            man on a hill with a telescope” are also parsed as expected. In addition to ambiguity parsing errors can
            commonly occur from non-projective sentences or sentences in which long-distance syntactical errors occur.

          <p name="0ec3" id="0ec3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One problem associated with constituency parsing
            is that in order to use common algorithms like CKY, the sentence must be in <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_Normal_Form"
              data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_Normal_Form" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
              rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chomsky Normal Form</a> (CNF). This is a disadvantage because it is often
            difficult to convert free word order languages, for example, many Slavic languages. This can be resolved by
            using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_and_reference_grammar"
              data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_and_reference_grammar"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Role and reference grammar</a>
            (RRG) rather than context-free grammar transformed into CNF. Role and reference grammar’s main feature is
            that it utilizes lexical decompensation. Lexical semantics are words, sub-words and units of words. RRG
            breaks down the sentence into lexical parts and using an analysis of clause structure in order to form a
            sentence hierarchy. Role and reference grammar is less popular than constituency parsing but provides the
            advantage of being able to easily parse free word order languages.</p>
          <p name="0d0a" id="0d0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dependency parsing differs from syntactical
            parsing as it uses dependency grammar and displays only the relationships between words rather than the
            sentence structure and relationship. Dependency trees are often more concise than constituency trees because
            they only display grammar between a governor and is dependents. Similar to constituency parsing dependency
            is helpful in word processing systems and grammar checking.</p>
          <p name="8f00" id="8f00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Common algorithms used in dependency parsing are
            treebank searching algorithms like <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00185"
              data-href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00185"

            neural network which is what <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/nndep.shtml"

          <p name="ef45" id="ef45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dependency parsing’s one key advantage over
            constituency is that it has the ability to parse relatively free word order. This allows languages such as
            Latin, which has no fixed order, to be parsed. Dependency parsing also performs better when parsing
            non-projective and fragmented sentences. Constituency parsing’s advantage over constituency parsing is its
            ability to display the entire structure of a sentence rather than simply the word associations.</p>
          <p name="959b" id="959b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When developing and testing my application I ran
            into a few limitations and bugs. The first limitation is that currently the project only supports parsing
            English, however I do have ideas on how to expand the languages available in the future. An interesting
            aspect is that if there are multiple interpretations of a sentence (i.e. if the sentence is ambiguous) the
            parser only displays one of them and does not inform the user that there are other interpretations. This can
            be seen with the elephant example from above. The common interpretation that the man is in his pajamas is
            the rendered tree. I would like to inform the user of the number of possible parses and allow them to select
            which parse they want to visualize. Another interesting bug in the program is that the last letter inputted
            is not parsed or displayed on the tree. I have a feeling that this is due to how state is handled in my
            application. This bug does not affect how the sentence is parsed, since it is the last letter in the
            sentence, but it could lead to confusion of the user.</p>
          <p name="8e00" id="8e00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Constituency and dependency parsing
            share many characteristics in how and what they can parse. Many of the algorithms such as Shift-Reducer and
            the use of Neural Nets are commonly used in both parsing techniques. However, they differ in what they
            produce and how effective they are. Dependency parsing displays only relationships between words and their
            constitutes while constituency parsing displays the entire sentence structure and relationships. Often
            dependency parsing is praised for being concise yet informative, but constituency parsing is often easier to
            read and understand. Working on this project I learned that while constituency and dependency parsing have
            their differences and specific use cases. They provide very similar results and the decision on which to use
            is ultimately up to you and your preferences.</p>
