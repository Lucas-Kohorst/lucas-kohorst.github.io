# generations
i have been iterating on generations, a casual gaming studio, building impactful games. 

first we introduce a word game. based on the current news 3 blurbs are shown 2 are real (bloomberg, wsj, nyt, etc.) 1 is generated with an LLM. 

more than half of all new content on the [internet is generative](https://theconversation.com/more-than-half-of-new-articles-on-the-internet-are-being-written-by-ai-is-human-writing-headed-for-extinction-268354). it continues to be harder to identify this content as model improve. 

as younger generations get online for the first time it's likely they will not be able to tell what is human written or generative.

generations is focused on being a fun / casual word game and more importantly helping players to increase their ability of detecting generative content. 

you can play it at [generations.work](https://generations.work)
