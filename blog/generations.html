  <h1>generations, a casual gaming studio</h1>
  <div class="date">20 Feb, 2026</div>

  <p>i have been iterating on generations, a casual gaming studio, building impactful games.</p>

  <p>first we introduce a word game. based on the current news 3 blurbs are shown 2 are real (bloomberg, wsj, nyt, etc.) 1 is generated with an LLM.</p>

  <p>more than half of all new content on the <a href="https://theconversation.com/more-than-half-of-new-articles-on-the-internet-are-being-written-by-ai-is-human-writing-headed-for-extinction-268354">internet is generative</a>. it continues to be harder to identify this content as models improve.</p>

  <p>as younger generations get online for the first time it's likely they will not be able to tell what is human written or generative.</p>

  <p>generations is focused on being a fun / casual word game and more importantly helping players to increase their ability of detecting generative content.</p>

  <p>you can play it at <a href="https://generations.work">generations.work</a></p>
