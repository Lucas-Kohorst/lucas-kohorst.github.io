    Studied computer science at <a href="https://rit.edu/">RIT</a>, until being introduced to crypto/blockchain and started to build a subscription marketplace for netflix subscriptions. Liking the space so much I created and graduated with an individualized blockchain based major (courses that formed this major can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lucas-Kohorst/blockchain-technology-rit">here</a>). 
   </p>
   <p>
    2020 I started working at a new subsidiary of <a href="https://dcg.co">Digital Currency Group</a>, <a href="https://foundrydigital.com">Foundry</a>. Since being at Foundry we have grown to the <a href="https://explorer.btc.com/btc/insights-pools">largest bitcoin mining pool in the world</a>, financed a <a href="https://foundrydigital.com/news">large amount of mining operations</a>, and launched an <a href="https://blockworks.co/foundry-digital-launches-staking-business-as-institutions-become-comfortable/">institutional staking business</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Following the launch of the staking business I have worked more on r&d and venture investing, exploring and structuring staking/blockspace derivatives, custody frameworks, and improving the operation of high performance and uptime validators
