    Studied computer science at <a href="https://rit.edu/">RIT</a>, until being introduced to crypto/blockchain and started to build a subscription marketplace for netflix subscriptions. Liking the space so much I created and graduated with an individualized blockchain based major (courses that formed this major can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lucas-Kohorst/blockchain-technology-rit">here</a>).
